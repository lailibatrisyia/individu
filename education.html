	<p align="center" style="color:whitesmoke;">This is the most challenging life for me.<br> Spending a degree for 3 years is not an easy path, in fact, it requires a lot of hard work to achieve the dream.<br>Thankfully, every semester I get a result of 3.8 and above with the help of lecturers and friends while learning up to this level.<br>Life at Uitm is very gloomy because we only study online and do not have the opportunity to meet each other.</p>
